# Azure-Data-Engineering-Project
Problem Statement
Organizations today generate vast amounts of data from various sources, requiring efficient and scalable data pipelines to integrate, transform, and analyze information in real time. However, designing a robust data pipeline that ensures seamless data ingestion, transformation, and storage while maintaining performance, scalability, and reliability remains a challenge.

In this project, data is sourced from GitHub using an API, necessitating effective extraction, processing, and storage mechanisms. The challenge lies in designing a data pipeline using Azure Data Factory for ingestion, Databricks for transformation, and Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics. Additionally, implementing best practices for handling big data solutions and real-time processing with Apache Spark is crucial to ensuring data integrity and high performance.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a scalable and optimized data pipeline that can handle large volumes of data efficiently while ensuring seamless integration across Azure services.
